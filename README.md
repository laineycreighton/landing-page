## Description

This project serves as a demonstration of fundamental HTML and CSS skills through the creation of a mock web application landing page. By developing this landing page from scratch, I aimed to exhibit my grasp of key concepts including semantic elements, form integration, the utilization of classes and IDs, and the practice of thorough code commenting. The page was built entirely without the use of starter code, showcasing my ability to craft a webpage from the ground up.

## Learning Points

- How to use flexbox.
- How to create a linked navigation menu.
- How to create forms.
- How to use HTML semantic elements.
- How to use class, id, element, and universal selectors in CSS.

<br>

## Features

- **Semantic Elements:** The landing page employs a variety of semantic HTML elements to enhance the structure and accessibility of the content.

- **Form Integration:** A functional form is integrated, demonstrating the ability to capture user input and process it using HTML forms.

- **CSS Styling:** The page is styled using CSS, with classes and IDs used for precise targeting of elements and styling enhancements.

- **Code Comments:** Throughout the HTML and CSS files, you'll find comprehensive comments detailing the purpose and functionality of different sections of code.
